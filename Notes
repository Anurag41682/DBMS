DBMS: It is a set of interrelated data and set of program to access those data.The primary goal of DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrive those
      data which is both convenient and efficient.
Database: It is collection of data relevant to an enterprise.
Data: It is collection of raw facts and figures.There is is no role of information here.
Information: It is the result of data processing which can help people for decision making. Data is the most important element here.
Knowledge: It is collection of useful and interesting information. Information is the main element here.
Data Redundancy: Redundancy of data means having same set of data many times at different locations.
                Disadvantages: Storage space is wasted.
                               Duplication of efforts as same data has to be manipulated at all the locations.
                               Leads to inconsistency.
Data Inconsitency: It is the condition in which two records reveals different information about the same entity and we are not able to judge which is 
                   correct.
Data Dictionary: It is the integral part of the database. It stores information about the database and the data it stores called metadata.It holds the 
                 information about each data element in the database. Such as names, types, range of values, access authorization, indicate which
                 application program uses the data.
Two-Tier Architecture: A two tier architecture in dbms is a datbase architecture in which the presentation layer is present on the client side and data is
                       stored on the server called the second tier. In this there is added security as data is not exposed to end user directly.
Three-Tier Architecture: A three Tier Architecture in DBMS is the most popular client server architecture in DBMS.
                         Three Tier architecture contains a presentation layer, an application layer, and a database server.
Component Module of DBMS: A database system is partitioned into modules that deal with all the responsibilities of the overall system.
                          The functional component of database can be divided into storage manager and query processor.
                          Query Processor:
                                          1.DDL (Data Definition Language) interpreter: Executes low level statements and record them in set of tables.
                                          2.DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler: Converts DML statements in source form of query language into
                                                                                       neccessary object (low level instructon) that query evaluation 
                                                                                       engine understands.
                                          3.DML precompiler: Convert DML statements embedded in application program to normal procedure calls in host 
                                                             Language.
                                          4.Query Evaluation engine: Execute low level instruction generated by DML compiler.
                          Storage manager:
                                          1.Authorization and integrity manager: Checks the authority of users to access data.
                                          2.Transaction Manager: Ensures data consistency despite system failure.
                                          3.Buffer Manager: Responsible for fetching data from disk to main memory.
                                          4.File manager: Manages allocation of space on disk storage.
                                          
File System: A file System is a software that manages and organizes the files in a storage medium. Storing and retrieving of data can't be done 
            efficiently in a file system. It doesn't offer data recovery process. It doesn't have crash recovery mechanism.Protecting a file system is 
            difficult.Redundancy of data is more. Data inconsistency is higher.No support for complicated transactions. Concurrency (multiple transaction
            at once) control is not provided. Cost of software is cheaper.
            
DBMS System: A DBMS system is software to access, create and manage databases. vice-versa.
Data models: A data models define the logical structure of database.It introduce abstraction to DBMS.It also defines how data is connected to each other
             processed and stored inside the system.
